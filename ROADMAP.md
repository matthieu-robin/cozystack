# Cozystack Roadmap

**Status:** Living document — updated quarterly by the maintainers. **Horizon:** May 2026 – May 2028 (two-year forward window). **Last updated:** 2026-08-25.

This document describes where Cozystack is heading. It is the authoritative public roadmap. The granular issue-level view lives in [Project V2 #1 (Cozystack Roadmap)](https://github.com/orgs/cozystack/projects/1); this file explains the *why* and the *how they fit together*.

**How to read the horizons.** Deliverables dated **2026 Q3 through 2027 Q1** are *commitments*: they have named owners, tracked issues, and capacity behind them. Everything dated **2027 Q2 and later** is *direction*: the problems we intend to solve and the order we intend to solve them in, restated every quarter as capacity and adoption become clearer. Direction items are deliberately not promises — a public roadmap that misses its own dates costs more credibility at a Graduation review than one that says plainly which parts are planned and which are intended.

## Executive Summary

By **May 2028**, Cozystack should be a credible candidate for the open standard platform layer for building clouds — recognized inside the CNCF ecosystem, adopted in production by organizations across multiple geographies and verticals, and governed openly by a community wider than any single company. Linux illustrates what "open standard for a category" looks like over decades; the two-year window covered here is the *starting condition* for that long arc, not the destination.

Concretely, success by the end of the horizon means all of the following are true at once:

- **CNCF maturity.** Project is **Incubating** (application submitted 2026 Q3) with a Graduated application drafted (2028 Q1). Third-party security audit complete and findings remediated.
- **Open specifications.** **Eight Cozystack-authored specifications** — CP-API (Package), CT-API (Tenant), Host OS Contract, GitOps Engine Interface, Fleet API, Cloud Native AI Inference Gateway, Block Replication CSI Extension, Tenant FinOps API — are in or through the relevant standards body process. At least one is ratified, and at least four have a second independent implementation.
- **Security posture.** OpenSSF Best Practices **Gold**, OSPS Baseline **L3**, OpenSSF Scorecard **≥ 9.0**, **SLSA Build L3**, CSAF VEX disclosure pipeline, EU CRA-compliant reporting, all-green CLOMonitor checks.
- **Storage independence.** **blockstor** as the production-default replicated block storage in Cozystack 3.0, with LINSTOR maintained as a legacy opt-in, governed inside Cozystack rather than as a separate foundation project.
- **AI/ML platform.** **Inference Gateway GA**, GPU FinOps tenant view, managed model registry, multi-tenant GPU sharing (MIG/vGPU/time-slicing), agentic and multi-modal workload support — all production-grade and documented as reference for NVIDIA NCP-aligned deployments.
- **Multi-cluster.** **Fleet API v1.0 GA**. Federation across ≥ 100 clusters in publicly attested production deployments.
- **Marketplace.** **≥ 100 certified applications** across sub-categories (AI/ML, Databases, Messaging, Observability, Security, Networking, DevTools). Third-party publisher program operating. Signed packages, SBOM-attested artifacts, vulnerability gates.
- **Conformance Program.** **Certified Cozystack Provider / App / Storage Backend / Host OS** all operating, with multiple certified entities per category.
- **Governance and community.** ≥ 10 active SIGs · ≥ 10 maintainers from ≥ 5 different organizations · ≥ 30 public production adopters · public vendor-neutrality dashboard live and maintained.
- **Adoption channels.** "Tested on Cozystack" hardware program with ≥ 20 certified configurations across ≥ 3 vendors · co-published host OS profiles with ≥ 4 Linux distributions · managed Cozystack offerings from European service providers · ≥ 12 conference talks per calendar year · **Cozystack Admin Certification (CCA) GA** with measurable labor-market presence.
- **Documentation and materials.** Versioned docs per supported release line · auto-generated API reference per release · 11 published reference architectures · technical whitepaper · security whitepaper · TCO calculator · vendor lock-in analysis · ≥ 5 published case studies · migration playbooks from VMware / OpenStack / Proxmox / KVM · Cozystack Academy with four courses live.
- **Compliance enablers for downstream.** PCI DSS v4.0.1 reference architecture · SOC 2 Type II evidence pack · ISO/IEC 5230 (OpenChain) self-certified · EU CRA shared-responsibility matrix · CIS Kubernetes Benchmark profile · Threat Model published.

None of these outcomes is achievable by code alone. Each requires sustained, coordinated work across **twelve strategic tracks** (§5), the **Standardization Strategy** (§8), and the **Conformance Program** (§6). The remainder of this document is the breakdown of how each commitment above is delivered.

The single fastest way to derail this plan is to remain a single-vendor project. Maintainer diversity (§5 Track 11) is the highest-priority risk mitigation in the entire roadmap.

## 1. Vision

Cozystack aims to become the open standard platform layer for building clouds — the same way Linux became the open standard for operating systems. Concretely, that means a platform that:

- Stays **vendor-neutral** and is governed openly under the CNCF.
- Defines a **stable Core API** with explicit backwards-compatibility guarantees.
- Ships a **Conformance Program** so that multiple distributions can exist while remaining interoperable.
- Treats **enterprise reliability, security, and compliance** as first-class concerns, not bolt-ons.
- Is a **first-class AI/ML platform** without giving up its general-purpose PaaS roots.

The two-year goal is to graduate from CNCF Sandbox to Incubating in 2026 and prepare the conditions for a Graduated application by the end of the horizon.

## 2. Strategic Layers

Cozystack is shaped as a layered offering:

- **Cozystack Core** — stable APIs, operator, package model, tenant model, auth, backup framework, observability primitives.
- **Cozystack Conformance** — public test suites for platforms, applications, storage backends, host OS profiles, and providers.
- **Cozystack Marketplace** — certified applications with version channels, signed artifacts, SBOM, and compatibility metadata.
- **Cozystack Enterprise Profile** — LTS release lines, upgrade policy, auditability, public scale envelope, compliance-ready architecture.
- **Cozystack AI Platform** — GPU lifecycle, datasets, model serving, model registry, vector databases, tenant isolation, FinOps for tokens/GPU-time.
- **Cozystack Fleet** — multi-cluster, multi-region, unified policy and identity, federated networking and lifecycle.

## 3. Current State (August 2026)

### 3.1 What is shipped

- `v1.0` — package-based architecture, `Package` / `PackageSource`, `cozystack-operator`, backup framework, VM backup, RWX for AI/ML workloads, non-Talos installs.
- `v1.2` — OpenSearch, VPC peering, `SchedulingClass`, clustered VictoriaLogs, production stabilization.

- GPU support in VMs and tenant Kubernetes (#1244)
- Topology and affinity settings (#1242)
- NUMA support for VMs (#1245)
- Air-gap installation support (#1243) — the base install path only. Three gaps are still open and are tracked for 2026 Q4 under Track 10: registry mirroring, preservation of image signatures when images are re-baked into a private registry, and air-gapped tenant Talos clusters, which have never been verified.
- New Cozystack UI foundation (#1252)
- Plugin system (#1259)
- Audit log (#1263)
- Backup and recovery system (#1248)
- Decomposition and extensibility (#1249)
- API stabilization and `v1.0.0` release (#1251)
- Installation on multiple Linux distributions (#1260)
- API Gateway support (#1265)
- ComputePlane tenant module for untrusted-code workloads (#3280, merged 2026-07-29) — the module itself; E2E coverage (#3369) and the release-name guards (#3371) are still open and are tracked for 2026 Q4.

### 3.3 In flight or rescheduled

This list mirrors the open items on [Project V2 #1](https://github.com/orgs/cozystack/projects/1). The board is the issue-level source of truth; if the two disagree, the board is right and this section is stale.

- Internal Development Platform bundle (#1247) — moved to 2027 Q1.
- Selecting managed application versions (#1246) — rescheduled to Q3 2026.
- Grafana dashboard with SLA for each service (#1262) — rescheduled to Q3 2026.
- Distroless images (#1261) — Q4 2026.
- Automated platform updates (#1266) — Q4 2026.
- Backups for managed apps (#1713) — Q4 2026; per-application backup strategies are being landed app by app.
- Replace Helm `lookup` with OpenBao + ESO + operator architecture (#1942) — Q4 2026.
- Adopt the kstatus readiness model platform-wide (#2642) — Q4 2026.
- Unified TLS certificate and external-exposure model (#2811) — Q4 2026; the contract behind per-application TLS.
- Diff-driven and scenario-based E2E testing (#2847) — Q3 2026; see Track 2, this is the gating item for the release train.
- Cilium: version pins, Gateway API, network policy, IPAM and load-balancer issues (#3913) — Q3–Q4 2026.
- Routed site-to-site IPsec gateway app (#3426) — Q3 2026; the implementation is essentially complete and waiting on review.
- cozyplane — eBPF CNI and the `cozyplane-kpr` networking variant that drops Cilium (#3149) — Q4 2026, `experimental`.
- Dynamic API group registration via `ApplicationGroupDefinition` (#3448) — 2027 Q1; downstream of the core / apps separation decision below.
- Per-tenant egress IP via kube-ovn SNAT (#3755) — Q4 2026.
- E2E coverage for the ComputePlane module (#3369) — Q4 2026.

### 3.4 Tracks in flight not yet captured in Project V2

- **blockstor** — Go-native Kubernetes block-storage control plane (LINSTOR REST-compatible). Active development in [cozystack/blockstor](https://github.com/cozystack/blockstor).
- **kilo-clustermesh-operator** — WireGuard-based multi-cluster mesh control plane.
- **cozystack-ui** — pure SPA Console/Marketplace UI talking directly to the Kubernetes API with `ApplicationDefinition`-based dynamic discovery.
- **ccp** — Cozystack Claude Plugins marketplace for AI-assisted platform operations.
- **standalone-trustd** — Talos `trustd` extracted as a standalone certificate-signing service.
- **cozystack-scheduler** — custom scheduler hooks for workload-aware scheduling (GPU, NUMA, locality).
- **cnai-landscape** — CNAI landscape submission preparation.

The two-year plan brings these tracks into the public roadmap. Vulnerability triage additionally runs through an automated CVE pipeline. Its outputs are public — advisories, CSAF VEX documents and SBOMs are all published — while the scanning tooling itself stays in a maintainer-only repository, because a public scanner queue tells an attacker which unpatched findings are still open. The process it implements is documented in `SECURITY.md`.

### 3.5 On the board without a public issue yet

These six items carry capacity in the near-term plan and sit on [Project V2 #1](https://github.com/orgs/cozystack/projects/1) as drafts. They are listed here because the tracks below commit to them, and a commitment with nothing behind it is a wish. Each becomes a public issue when work starts on it.

- **Core / apps separation model** — 2026 Q4 decision, 2027 Q1 implementation. Three competing designs exist (monorepo with versioning versus multi-repo) and none has been chosen. This is the one open architectural question that gates the three items below it, so it is sequenced first deliberately.
- **Unit and integration test coverage** — 2026 Q4. Distinct from the E2E work in #2847: this covers the operator and controller Go code directly.
- **Air-gapped installation, remaining gaps** — 2026 Q4. See the note on #1243 above.
- **Per-cluster etcd for tenant Kubernetes** — 2027 Q1. The open question is migration for existing clusters: an honest migration versus a legacy flag that leaves current tenants on the shared instance.
- **Community application marketplace** — 2027 Q1. Design proposals exist in `cozystack/community` and are open, not merged.
- **Retire the `extra` apps category** — 2027 Q1, folding it into `apps`. Downstream of the separation model. Note that the ComputePlane module ships *as* an `extra` module, so this fold has to resolve where it lands.
- **Public IPs as a first-class resource** — 2026 Q4 design, 2027 Q1 implementation. Proposal open in `cozystack/community` with changes requested. See Track 1.
- **blockstor as an opt-in storage backend** — 2026 Q4 through 2027 Q1. See Track 4.
- **Community PR review process and duty rotation** — 2026 Q3. See Track 11.

## 5. Tracks

The roadmap is organized into twelve tracks. Each track lists deliverables by quarter and an indicative owning SIG (see §7 for SIG formation timeline).

### Track 1 — Platform Core (SIG-Platform)

**Goal.** Stable APIs, predictable upgrades, formal backwards-compatibility contract.

| Quarter | Deliverables |
|---|---|
| 2026 Q3 | Close in-flight items #1246 and #1262. Cut `v1.6.0` (shipped 2026-07-22; `v1.6.2` current). Publish `API Stability Policy` (alpha/beta/stable lanes, deprecation window). **Service exposure API** — settle the `ExposureClass` / `ServiceExposure` contract (#3164) that per-application external access and TLS both depend on. Scope the **GitOps Engine Abstraction** CzEP — decouple package delivery from the underlying engine so Flux remains the default while a second engine becomes feasible. |
| 2026 Q4 | Distroless images (#1261). Automated platform updates (#1266). Unified TLS and external-exposure model (#2811) landed across managed applications. Platform-wide kstatus readiness model (#2642). Helm `lookup` replaced by OpenBao + ESO (#1942). Per-tenant resource quotas (#752). **Public IPs as a first-class resource** — settle the `PublicIP` / `PublicIPClaim` / `PublicIPClass` model so that public addresses are allocatable platform resources rather than node addresses pasted into `Service.spec.externalIPs`; the migration off the current meaning of `externalIPs` is the hard part, and static IPs for VMs, a first-class BGP LoadBalancer path and the vpn app all wait behind it. **Per-tenant egress IP** (#3755) — tenant outbound traffic leaves on a dedicated tenant-owned address instead of the shared node IP, which is what abuse attribution, third-party allowlisting and per-IP billing all depend on; the kube-ovn NAT gateway machinery is already enabled on the host and no chart wires it. Database horizontal autoscaling (#3394). Public **Release Trains** policy: `stable`, `fast`, `LTS`. Public support matrix for Kubernetes / host OS / Cilium / KubeVirt / storage backends / **GitOps engines**. **Core / apps separation model decided** — pick one of the three competing designs (monorepo with versioning versus multi-repo) and publish the rationale; the marketplace, the `apps.cozystack.io` API split and the retirement of the `extra` category are all downstream of this and are sequenced after it. **cozyplane** — eBPF CNI plus the `cozyplane-kpr` networking variant that drops Cilium (#3149), shipped `experimental` and opt-in; Cilium remains the default. **Argo CD experimental support** as an alternative GitOps engine — package model adapts `Package` / `PackageSource` to `Application` / `ApplicationSet` semantics; documented as `experimental` and opt-in at install time. |
| 2027 Q1 | Internal Development Platform bundle (#1247). Core / apps separation implemented against the Q4 decision. Dynamic API group registration via `ApplicationGroupDefinition` (#3448), splitting managed applications onto `apps.cozystack.io`. `PublicIPClass` and the address allocator implemented, with `publishing.externalIPs` and the vpn app migrated onto it. **Per-cluster etcd for tenant Kubernetes** — with a documented migration path for existing tenant clusters, not a flag day. **Cozystack 2.0** — backwards-compatibility contract published; major API revision based on production feedback; HA control-plane improvements (stretched control plane, multi-AZ, etcd backup automation). **Argo CD support reaches alpha** — supported install path for greenfield clusters; not yet a migration target for existing Flux-based deployments. |
| 2027 Q2 | `Platform Health API` covering operator, packages, GitOps engine (Flux or Argo CD), storage, networking, backups, ingress, auth. Explicit lifecycle states for apps, backups, restores, VMs, tenant clusters. **Argo CD support reaches beta** — feature parity with Flux for tenant app delivery, including `ApplicationSet` patterns for multi-tenant fan-out. |
| 2027 Q3 | Performance optimizations based on H1 2027 benchmarks. Per-tenant resource isolation hardening (full cgroup v2 adoption, memory.high pressure). **Argo CD support reaches GA** as a fully-supported alternative engine; Flux→Argo CD migration tooling enters alpha. |
| 2027 Q4 | Documented Flux↔Argo CD migration paths for existing deployments. Both engines remain first-class. |
| 2028 Q1 | **Cozystack 3.0** — second major API revision. Deprecation of legacy `v1` surfaces on a documented timeline. |

### Track 2 — Testing & Conformance (SIG-Testing)

**Goal.** Testing as a first-class deliverable. A public **Cozystack Conformance Suite** that third parties can certify against.

| Quarter | Deliverables |
|---|---|
| 2026 Q3 | **Get the E2E pipeline green — the gating item for everything else in this quarter.** While it is red, releases, the merge queue and every large in-flight PR are blocked behind it. Diff-driven and scenario-based E2E (#2847): parallel post-install, event-driven backstops, pre-pull caching, lightweight kind/Talos-in-Docker clusters for diff-scoped runs (#3238). Close the diagnostics gap (#3368) — a third of red runs are currently undiagnosable. Document the test architecture. |
| 2026 Q4 | **Unit and integration coverage for the operator and controller code**, enforced in CI. E2E coverage for the ComputePlane module (#3369) — the layer underneath the E2E work, and today the thinnest. **Reproducible performance benchmark** — a published, re-runnable artifact plus the write-up, so that platform performance claims are verifiable by third parties rather than asserted. **Cozystack Conformance Suite v0.1** — public, runnable test suite covering install, tenant lifecycle, app lifecycle, backup/restore, networking, storage. Chaos-Mesh integration in e2e (node failure, network partition, DRBD split-brain scenarios). |
| 2027 Q1 | AI-augmented test generation: an LLM-based assistant proposes test cases for new behaviors on each PR; humans review and commit. Performance regression CI — benchmark suite gates merge. |
| 2027 Q2 | Long-running soak environment — a permanent cluster that runs reliability tests for weeks. Upgrade matrix — every RC passes the full N-2 → N upgrade matrix. |
| 2027 Q3 | **Public scale tests** — automated runs against 100/500/1000 nodes; published scale reports. |
| 2027 Q4 | **Cozystack Conformance Suite v1.0** — stable test contract for the Conformance Program. |
| 2028 Q1–Q2 | Third-party distributions can earn a "Cozystack Certified" badge by passing the suite. |

### Track 3 — Security, Certifications & Compliance (SIG-Security)

**Goal.** Bring the project to a security posture that supports CNCF Incubation, then Graduated, and supports downstream commercial users in audited environments. **This is the largest single track in the roadmap.**

Cozystack's security work is structured around ten external frameworks plus one internal program. Each is treated as a sub-project with concrete tasks.

#### Track 3.1 — OpenSSF Best Practices Badge (Metal series)

The legacy and still-required "Passing / Silver / Gold" badge program. CNCF Graduation requires only the Passing badge; Silver and Gold are suggested, not required, and are self-chosen targets here.

| Quarter | Target | Concrete tasks |
|---|---|---|
| 2026 Q3 | **Passing** (67 criteria) | Enroll project on [bestpractices.dev](https://www.bestpractices.dev/). Address all `MUST` items: public version-controlled source ✓, distinct contributing/security/code-of-conduct docs ✓ (already present), public bug tracker ✓, OSS license (Apache-2.0) ✓, build reproducibility documentation, automated test suite documented, public release notes per version, secure communication for vulnerability reports (private maintainer mailbox), warn on common cryptographic mistakes, vulnerability response policy with SLA, no public exposure of sensitive data in commits/issues. |
| 2027 Q2 | **Silver** (55 additional criteria) | DCO or CLA documented and enforced, two-person review for substantive changes (already required), branch protection on all release branches, automated `golangci-lint` + `gosec` on every PR (extend coverage), documented coding standards, documented release-signing process, signed Git tags for releases, security policy with vulnerability disclosure timeline, README references security policy, contribution metadata documented (size, scope, review). |
| 2027 Q4 | **Gold** (23 additional criteria) | Documented secure-design / threat model, fuzzing for critical components (blockstor, custom-scheduler, controllers), public SAST findings management, dynamic analysis (`go vet -race`, kube-conformance), CI-driven dependency-license check (FOSSA/ScanCode), reproducible builds for container images, branch protection includes required signed commits where supported. |

#### Track 3.2 — OSPS Baseline (Open Source Project Security Baseline)

The maturity-model framework — launched Feb 2025, current version dated 2026-02 — that is replacing "Gold-only" thinking. Has three levels organized by project maturity. Cozystack already qualifies for L3 by user-base; the work is bringing controls up to spec.

The eight control families (each ID `OSPS-XX-YY`):

- **AC** — Access Control
- **BR** — Build & Release
- **DO** — Documentation
- **GV** — Governance
- **LE** — Legal
- **QA** — Quality
- **SA** — Security Assessment
- **VM** — Vulnerability Management

| Quarter | Target level | Concrete tasks |
|---|---|---|
| 2026 Q3 | **L1 — Basic Hygiene** | All L1 controls. The project has most already; gap closure focus: documented release verification instructions (`OSPS-DO-03.*`), documented support scope (`OSPS-DO-04.01`), documented secret-management policy for CI (`OSPS-BR-07.02`). Self-assessment published in repo. |
| 2026 Q4 | **L2 — Standardized** | Two-person review required for primary branch (`OSPS-QA-07.01` — extend to enforcement), test execution documentation (`OSPS-QA-06.02`), tests required for major changes (`OSPS-QA-06.03`), threat-model artifacts (`OSPS-SA-03.02`), VEX documents for component-level vulnerabilities (`OSPS-VM-04.02`). |
| 2027 Q2 | **L3 — High Assurance** | Minimum-privilege CI/CD job assignments (`OSPS-AC-04.02`), formal review before granting escalated permissions (`OSPS-GV-04.01`), trusted-collaborator input sanitization in pipelines (`OSPS-BR-01.04`), unique-identifier release-asset association (`OSPS-BR-02.02`), publish verification instructions for release integrity AND authorship (`OSPS-DO-03.01` + `03.02`), document EOL timelines per release line (`OSPS-DO-05.01`), SBOM with compiled assets (`OSPS-QA-02.02`), equal-or-stricter security on multi-repo releases (`OSPS-QA-04.02`), dependency remediation thresholds + automated blocking (`OSPS-VM-05.01–03`), code-weakness remediation thresholds + automated blocking (`OSPS-VM-06.01–02`). |

The repository ships an `OSPS-BASELINE.md` self-assessment that maps every control to evidence and is regenerated on each release.

#### Track 3.3 — OpenSSF Scorecard

Automated weekly checks producing a numeric score. CNCF sets no numeric Scorecard threshold for either tier; the levels below are self-chosen targets (around ≥ 7.0 by Incubation, ≥ 8.0 toward Graduated).

| Quarter | Target | Concrete tasks |
|---|---|---|
| 2026 Q3 | **≥ 6.0** | Enable Scorecard GitHub Action across all org repositories. Publish badge in README. Address quick wins: pinned dependencies in CI, branch-protection metadata, signed releases, no binary artifacts in source tree. |
| 2026 Q4 | **≥ 7.0** | Token-permissions least-privilege in every workflow, dependency-update-tool (Dependabot/Renovate enforced), code-review for every merge, signed commits where practical. |
| 2027 Q2 | **≥ 8.0** | SAST integration, fuzzing presence, CII Best Practices score reflection. |
| 2027 Q4 | **≥ 9.0** | All applicable checks pass; only systemic exceptions remain documented. |

#### Track 3.4 — SLSA — Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts

Build-side integrity, tracked against the current SLSA v1.2 specification (Build track). SLSA is not a stated CNCF graduation requirement; Build L3 is a self-chosen aspirational target.

| Quarter | Target | Concrete tasks |
|---|---|---|
| 2026 Q3 | **Build L1** | Provenance generation for every release artifact (container images, Helm charts, binaries). Publish as `.intoto.jsonl` next to releases. |
| 2026 Q4 | **Build L2** | Hosted-build platform (GitHub Actions OIDC + slsa-github-generator). Authenticated provenance with signed `_provenance` files. |
| 2027 Q3 | **Build L3** | Hardened build platform: isolated build steps, non-falsifiable provenance, no human override of build pipeline; reusable workflows audited; secrets handled via OIDC short-lived tokens only. |

#### Track 3.5 — CNCF CLOMonitor

CNCF-wide automated check dashboard. Must be all-green for Incubation review.

| Quarter | Deliverables |
|---|---|
| 2026 Q3 | Verify all CLOMonitor checks. Address gaps: project metadata, governance, security policy, adopters file completeness, contributor ladder, license, code of conduct, OpenSSF badge, artifact signing, SBOM. |

#### Track 3.6 — CNCF Security Self-Assessment + Third-Party Audit

| Quarter | Deliverables |
|---|---|
| 2026 Q3 | Complete the **CNCF TAG Security self-assessment** ([template](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/community/assessments/guide/self-assessment.md)). Publish as `SECURITY-SELF-ASSESSMENT.md` in repo. Include attack-surface diagram, trust boundaries, threat model, and known weaknesses with mitigation status. |
| 2027 Q3 | Engage a **third-party audit** (e.g. Ada Logics with OSTIF funding, or NCC Group). Scope: core controllers, blockstor, custom scheduler, multi-tenancy boundaries, supply chain. Required for Graduated tier. |
| 2027 Q4 | Publish audit results and remediation status. Triage findings into milestones. |

#### Track 3.7 — EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)

The CRA's reporting obligations apply from **11 September 2026**; full obligations from **11 December 2027**. Cozystack itself, as an OSS project, falls under the *open-source software steward* regime of CRA Article 24 ("Obligations of open-source software stewards"), not the *manufacturer* obligations. But downstream commercial vendors who package Cozystack are manufacturers. We document the project so that downstream compliance is tractable.

| Quarter | Deliverables |
|---|---|
| 2026 Q3 | Publish a **`CRA-COMPLIANCE.md`** describing: (a) the project's status as an open-source software steward under Article 24, (b) the CVE coordinated-disclosure process aligning with CRA timelines (24h initial / 72h info / 14d final after fix or workaround for actively exploited issues), (c) SBOM availability per release. |
| 2026 Q3 | Adopt **CSAF VEX** for vulnerability advisories. Publish each advisory as a CSAF JSON file alongside the GHSA. |
| 2026 Q4 | SBOM in **SPDX** and **CycloneDX** formats published with every release; signed with cosign. |
| 2027 Q1 | Document the **shared-responsibility matrix** between Cozystack maintainers and downstream commercial vendors for incident response. |
| 2027 Q4 | Verify the disclosure pipeline against CRA timeline obligations with a tabletop exercise. |

#### Track 3.8 — SOC 2 (Process Readiness, not Certification)

An OSS project does not get SOC 2 itself — services do. We deliver a **process evidence pack** that any commercial Cozystack distributor can use in their own SOC 2 audit.

| Quarter | Deliverables |
|---|---|
| 2027 Q1 | **SOC 2 Type I evidence pack** — `SOC2-EVIDENCE/` directory with: change-management policy, access-control policy for the GitHub org, incident-response runbook, vendor/dependency-management policy, backup/DR documentation, monitoring/audit-log policy. |
| 2027 Q3 | **Type II evidence-collection automation** — GitHub Actions snapshot monthly evidence (permission grants, branch-protection state, release-signing logs, CVE triage decisions) to `SOC2-EVIDENCE/`. |

### Track 4 — Storage Independence: blockstor (SIG-Storage)

**Goal.** A Kubernetes-native, Go-native, community-governed block storage control plane, and long-term Cozystack's default replicated block storage.

blockstor and cozyplane are governed **inside the existing Cozystack governance**, not as separate foundation projects: the contributor ladder, CLA, security process and release policy that apply to Cozystack apply to them unchanged. A separate CNCF submission for either component is explicitly out of scope for this horizon — it would add governance overhead without adding governance.

Positioning: **not** "anti-LINSTOR". LINSTOR solved a real problem; the ecosystem needs a Go-native, Kubernetes-native, community-governed alternative. blockstor is built with LINSTOR REST API compatibility so existing clients (`linstor-csi`, `piraeus-operator`, `ha-controller`, `golinstor`) continue to work.

| Quarter | Deliverables |
|---|---|
| 2026 Q3 | Feature-parity audit against LINSTOR. Conformance tests against `linstor-csi` and friends. Vanilla Kubernetes demo. |
| 2026 Q4 | Pilot deployments on 3 production clusters in shadow mode (alongside LINSTOR, not replacing it). `cozystack-migrate-storage` tooling, **including the reverse path** — a backend nobody can migrate off is a backend nobody will adopt. Broaden the contributor base beyond a single maintainer before blockstor becomes load-bearing. |
| 2027 Q1 | blockstor **alpha** in Cozystack 2.0 as an opt-in storage backend. LINSTOR remains the default; it is marked deprecated only once blockstor has production mileage and a working reverse migration. New blockstor capabilities: VDUSE backend, shared-LUN production mode, BYOK key rotation, snapshot shipping to S3-compatible storage. |
| 2027 Q2 | Engagement with LINBIT: contribute back relevant fixes; align long-term coexistence story. **Required for CNCF vendor-neutrality posture.** |
| 2027 Q3 | blockstor **beta** in Cozystack 2.1: dual-stack mode default, blockstor used for new installs unless opted out. Migration tooling tested at scale. Production-scale tests: ≥ 1000 PVs with DRBD replication, ≥ 100 TB shared storage. |
| 2027 Q4 | Performance benchmarks vs LINSTOR published. DR documentation. Storage Conformance Suite v1. |
| 2028 Q1–Q2 | blockstor **GA** in Cozystack 3.0. LINSTOR support enters legacy mode (security backports only). |

### Track 5 — Host OS Strategy (SIG-OS)

**Goal.** Reduce single-source dependency on Talos Linux without forking it into a standalone distribution prematurely. A full Linux distribution fork is a multi-year, multi-engineer investment that risks turning Cozystack into a distro vendor at the expense of being a platform standard.

The correct sequence:

1. Document the **`Host OS Contract`** — what Cozystack expects from any host OS (kernel modules, container runtime, kubelet, sysctl, networking, storage drivers, GPU drivers, secure-boot story, AppArmor/SELinux posture).
2. Build a **Host Conformance Suite** so host profiles can be certified.
3. Bring multiple host profiles (Talos, Ubuntu, Debian, kubeadm, k3s, RKE2) to production-quality.
4. Talos stays a **first-class** profile; Sidero stays a partner.
5. Fork Talos only if upstream blocks critical storage / GPU / kernel / security changes — and even then, fork *minimally*, upstream-first.

| Quarter | Deliverables |
|---|---|
| 2026 Q3 | Publish `HOST-OS-CONTRACT.md`. OS Support Matrix (Tier-1 Talos production-supported; Tier-2 Ubuntu 24.04 / Debian 12 / Flatcar community-supported; Tier-3 RHEL 9 / Rocky 9 experimental). |
| 2026 Q4 | Extract Talos-dependent services as standalone (continuing what `standalone-trustd` established). Targets: `standalone-machined-bootstrap`, `standalone-cluster-config`. |
| 2027 Q1 | Partnership statement with Sidero on long-term collaboration (vendor-neutrality posture). |
| 2027 Q2 | If partnership posture is not achievable, scope a minimal **cozyOS** image (Talos-derived, kept upstream-first, customized only via Talos extensions). |
| 2027 Q4 | Public case studies for multi-OS production deployments. |
| 2028 Q1+ | Decide whether cozyOS becomes a standalone effort. Only if all higher-priority tracks are stable. |

### Track 6 — AI/ML Platform (SIG-AI)

**Goal.** Cozystack as the open standard for running AI/ML workloads on private cloud and on-prem GPU clusters.

| Quarter | Deliverables |
|---|---|
| 2026 Q3 | Submit Cozystack to the **CNAI Landscape** (Cloud Native AI). Release **cozyllm** under an open-source licence. Document the existing GPU-as-a-service path end to end — the capability is already in the platform and the gap is documentation, not code. |
| 2026 Q4 | AI workload presets: `inference-bundle` (vLLM / SGLang / TensorRT-LLM), `rag-bundle`. Managed vector databases as first-class apps: Qdrant, pgvector. GPU sharing improvements (MIG, vGPU, time-slicing) in multi-tenant with per-tenant quotas. |
| 2027 Q1 | **AI Platform MVP**: GPU inventory + GPU quotas, NVIDIA GPU Operator integration, topology-aware GPU scheduling, GPU billing metrics, model serving packages, model registry, S3/RWX dataset workflows. |
| 2027 Q2 | **Inference Gateway** — OpenAI-compatible endpoint routing to Dynamo / vLLM / TRT-LLM under the hood, with token-level billing, rate limiting, model registry integration. Tenant-side GPU FinOps dashboard (token-time, GPU-time, KV-cache hits, prefill/decode split). |
| 2027 Q3 | Agentic workload orchestration managed apps (Letta, AutoGen-class). Temporal as a managed app. Approved-model registry with signed-model provenance. |
| 2027 Q4 | **AI Platform GA**: inference gateway, autoscaling, model lifecycle, private model registry, GPU pools, cost allocation, dataset versioning, secure model import, audit trails. Multi-modal support (video/audio generation workloads with scheduling profiles). |
| 2028 Q1+ | Reference platform for NCP-aligned GPU cloud providers. |

### Track 7 — AI Inside Cozystack (SIG-AI, AI-Ops sub-group)

**Goal.** AI assists in operating the platform itself — read-only and human-approved first; gradually expand to safe auto-remediation.

| Quarter | Deliverables |
|---|---|
| 2026 Q3 | Expand the `ccp` (Cozystack Claude Plugins) marketplace to 20+ plugins: `cozy-debug`, `cozy-cve-triage`, `cozy-perf-investigate`, `cozy-cost-optimize`, `cozy-capacity-plan`. |
| 2026 Q4 | **Assistant inside the Cozystack dashboard**, able to run fully **self-hosted** against a local model — regulated environments frequently prohibit sending cluster state to an external provider, so an assistant that only works against a hosted API is unusable exactly where the platform is most valuable. `cozyhr` enhancement: LLM-powered Helm-value generation from natural language. |
| 2027 Q1 | **`cozydoctor`** — built-in diagnostics service. Inputs: events, logs, metrics, HelmRelease states, WorkloadMonitor, cozyreport. Output: probable root cause + suggested next step. Read-only mode by default. |
| 2027 Q2 | AI-powered alert routing and root-cause analysis: correlates Prometheus + Loki + Tempo into structured findings. Upgrade impact analyzer for risky packages, immutable fields, breaking changes. |
| 2027 Q3 | Self-healing automation for documented patterns (DRBD split-brain, etcd disk pressure, image-pull backoff) — human-approval gate on every write action; audit log on every action. |
| 2027 Q4 | Capacity planner: forecasts 3–6 months ahead, generates IaC PRs for capacity changes. |

Guardrail: any write-action by AI assistance requires **explicit user approval** and is **audit-logged**.

### Track 8 — Marketplace & Application Ecosystem (SIG-Apps)

**Goal.** A controlled supply-chain layer, not a YAML storefront.

| Quarter | Deliverables |
|---|---|
| 2026 Q3 | `ApplicationDefinition` schema v1: metadata, dependencies, compatibility matrix, version channels. Private OCI registry credentials support. UI catalog in `cozystack-ui`. |
| 2026 Q4 | App certification test framework (basic conformance). Signed application packages (cosign). Publisher onboarding documentation. |
| 2027 Q1 | **Marketplace alpha**, gated on the core / apps separation decision landing in 2026 Q4 — the packaging contract and the publisher path are the deliverable here, not the storefront: how a third party packages an application, how it is supported and updated, on what terms, and why it is safe to install. Retire the `extra` apps category by folding it into `apps`. **External Apps Program** — third-party orgs may publish via formalized submission and vetting. Target: 30 apps in marketplace. |
| 2027 Q2 | Paid-app support for commercial publishers. Marketplace federation for private/enterprise instances. |
| 2027 Q3 | Vulnerability scanning gates and SBOM publication for every marketplace app. App lifecycle hooks and upgrade policies. **Marketplace beta**. |
| 2027 Q4 | Target: 100 apps. Sub-categories (AI/ML, Databases, Messaging, Observability, Security, Networking, DevTools). **Marketplace GA**. |
| 2028 Q1–Q2 | Marketplace analytics (success rates, popular apps). **Certified Apps program** GA. |

### Track 9 — Multi-Cluster & Federation (SIG-Network)

**Goal.** Cozystack federation as a first-class concept — operating 10+ clusters as one platform.

| Quarter | Deliverables |
|---|---|
| 2026 Q3 | `kilo-clustermesh-operator` GA. Documented use cases. Routed site-to-site IPsec gateway app (#3426) — connect a tenant network to external sites over a routed tunnel. |
| 2026 Q4 | Multi-cluster `ApplicationDefinitions` — deploy an app to N clusters from one control point. |
| 2027 Q1 | **Fleet API alpha**. Tenant-to-tenant allowlisted peering. Per-tenant podCIDR / serviceCIDR planning. Identity federation. |
| 2027 Q2 | **Fleet beta**: cross-cluster mesh, global DNS, centralized policy, multi-cluster observability. Cross-cluster failover automation for stateless workloads. |
| 2027 Q3 | Geo-distributed managed services: PostgreSQL multi-region active-passive; MongoDB sharded cross-cluster. Public reference architectures (multi-region). |
| 2027 Q4 | **Fleet GA**. |
| 2028 Q1+ | 100-cluster federation production case studies. |

### Track 10 — Developer Experience & Reference Architectures (SIG-DX)

**Goal.** Golden paths. Cozystack works "out of the box" for each named vertical.

| Quarter | Deliverables |
|---|---|
| 2026 Q3 | Reference architectures published as `reference-architectures/`: GPU cloud provider, hosting provider, telco (5G CNF), fintech (PCI-aligned), research/HPC. **GitLab integration alpha** — GitLab as a first-class repository source for `Package` / `PackageSource` and tenant Helm releases (private repos, deploy tokens, group-level credentials). |
| 2026 Q4 | **`cozystack` CLI 2.0** — single entry point replacing `make` + `kubectl` + `helm` patchwork, built on a shared Go library. **MCP server** over that same library, so platform operations are available to AI assistants without a second implementation. **GitLab OAuth handshake** at tenant level for self-service onboarding alongside the existing OIDC flow. **Air-gapped installation completed** — registry mirroring, image signatures preserved when images are re-baked into a private registry, and air-gapped tenant Talos clusters verified end to end. The base path shipped under #1243; these are the gaps that keep it from being usable in a regulated environment. |
| 2027 Q1 | Backstage plugin for Cozystack. Crossplane Provider for Cozystack. **GitLab CI integration**: a managed-app **GitLab Runner** that tenants can deploy into their namespace for build pipelines, with per-tenant runner registration tokens and quota integration. |
| 2027 Q2 | OpenTofu/Terraform provider. DORA metrics dashboard for tenants. **GitLab Container Registry and GitLab Helm Registry** supported as first-class sources for Marketplace `ApplicationDefinitions`, alongside OCI registries. |
| 2027 Q3 | Sustainability/carbon metrics (Kepler integration). **Cozystack GitLab plugin** — GitLab CI components for `cozystack-deploy` and `cozystack-promote`, plus a GitLab-native view of tenant deployments. Symmetric work for GitHub Actions. |
| 2027 Q4 | Migration playbooks: from OpenStack, from VMware, from legacy KVM. GitLab integration reaches GA. |

### Track 11 — Ecosystem Standardization & Community (SIG-Governance)

**Goal.** Turn Cozystack from "one organization makes the platform" into "ecosystem makes the standard". This is the strategic transformation without which the "Linux of platforms" goal cannot land.

| Quarter | Deliverables |
|---|---|
| 2026 Q3 | Form SIGs (wave 1): SIG-Platform, SIG-Security, SIG-Docs — the three the Incubation review actually leans on. Biweekly meetings on a public calendar. |
| 2026 Q4 | Form SIGs (wave 2): SIG-Testing, SIG-Storage, SIG-Network. |
| 2027 Q1 | Form SIGs (wave 3): SIG-AI, SIG-Apps, SIG-DX, SIG-OS, SIG-Governance. A SIG is created when there is a maintainer to chair it and recurring work to own — creating eleven at once would produce eleven empty calendars. |
| 2026 Q3 | Onboard 2+ maintainers from organizations other than the founding company. (CNCF Incubation expectation.) |
| 2026 Q3 | **Community review process**: published rules for handling community pull requests, a weekly duty rotation so product understanding does not concentrate in one maintainer, an `in progress` label to prevent collisions, and a stated per-maintainer review norm. This is the mechanism behind the maintainer-diversity goal above, not a separate initiative — external contributors who wait months for a first response do not become maintainers. |
| 2026 Q3 | **Adopter list ≥ 10** production adopters published in `ADOPTERS.md`. |
| 2026 Q3 | **Submit CNCF Incubation application**. |
| 2026 Q3 | Adopt a **Cozystack Enhancement Proposal (CzEP)** process modeled on KEP — status states, sponsorship, voting. The `cozystack/community/design-proposals/` directory becomes the canonical location. |
| 2026 Q4 | Cozystack Annual Report 2026 published. Public quarterly roadmap reviews. |
| 2027 Q1 | First **Cozystack Conference** (in-person or virtual). |
| 2027 Q2 | **Cozystack Academy** — formal training modules, free tier on the website. |
| 2027 Q3 | **Cozystack Admin Certification (CCA)** beta — testing & certification track. |
| 2027 Q4 | **Cozystack Distribution Program** — third parties may build certified distributions (similar to Kubernetes Certified Distributions). |
| 2028 Q1 | Begin work on **CNCF Graduation application**. |
| 2028 Q2 | First public **vendor-neutrality dashboard** — commits-by-org, maintainers-by-org, releases-by-org transparency. |

### Track 12 — Documentation, Website & Community Materials (SIG-Docs)

**Goal.** A documentation, website, and content portfolio that matches the ambitions of the platform. Adopters, downstream commercial vendors, TOC reviewers, and conference attendees must each find what they need in less than two minutes.

## 6. Cozystack Conformance Program

The capstone deliverable of the two-year plan. Run by SIG-Testing and SIG-Governance jointly.

Four certifications:

- **Certified Cozystack Provider** — a deployment passes the Conformance Suite end-to-end on the provider's environment.
- **Certified Cozystack App** — a marketplace application meets app conformance (schema, signed artifacts, SBOM, lifecycle hooks, supported upgrade paths).
- **Certified Storage Backend** — a CSI-compatible storage backend passes the Storage Conformance Suite.
- **Certified Host OS** — a host OS profile passes the Host Conformance Suite.

Initial public versions land in 2028 Q1–Q2.

## 7. SIG Formation Timeline

SIGs are formed in three waves:

- **Wave 1 (2026 Q3):** SIG-Platform, SIG-Security, SIG-Docs. We consider these necessary to have in place before the Incubation review.
- **Wave 2 (2026 Q4):** SIG-Testing, SIG-Storage, SIG-Network.
- **Wave 3 (2027 Q1):** SIG-AI, SIG-Apps, SIG-DX, SIG-OS, SIG-Governance.

A SIG is formed when two conditions hold: a maintainer is willing to chair it, and there is recurring work for it to own. Standing up all eleven on one date would produce eleven empty calendars and a worse signal to a reviewer than three that meet.

Each SIG owns an area of the roadmap, holds a public weekly or biweekly meeting, maintains a charter in `community/sigs/<sig-name>/charter.md`, and reports to the maintainer group quarterly.

## 8. Standardization Strategy

Cozystack's long-term ambition — to become the open standard platform layer for building clouds — cannot be achieved by writing better software alone. Categories are defined by **specifications, not implementations**. Linux became Linux because of POSIX, LSB, FHS, and stable kernel ABIs that allowed distributions to multiply. Kubernetes became Kubernetes because of OCI, CRI, CSI, CNI, the Operator pattern, and a Conformance Program that distinguished compliant distributions from incompatible ones. Docker actually contributed its reference implementations to the community — containerd to the CNCF and runc to the OCI — yet Docker Engine still lost the Kubernetes runtime slot, because it never implemented the CRI interface and dockershim was eventually removed. The lesson is consistent: own the specification, let the ecosystem own the implementations.

This section enumerates the specifications Cozystack should define and own, the specifications Cozystack should adopt and champion, the bodies it should engage with, the distinguishing artifacts that should become the "Cozystack way," and the adoption playbook required for any of this to matter.

The work in this section is **cross-cutting** — it touches every track in §5. SIG-Governance is the primary owner, with each named SIG taking co-ownership of the spec relevant to its area.

### 8.1 Specifications Cozystack Should Define and Own

These are interfaces where no widely adopted standard exists today and where Cozystack is well positioned to draft, publish, and shepherd one through a standards body. Each spec is intended to follow this lifecycle: **CzEP draft → published spec in `cozystack/community/specs/` → submitted to a standards body → adopted by at least two independent implementations → ratified**.

#### 8.1.1 Cozystack Package API (`CP-API`)

**What.** A formal, vendor-neutral specification for cloud-native managed applications, formalizing the `Package`, `PackageSource`, and `ApplicationDefinition` constructs that already exist in Cozystack core. Covers schema, lifecycle hooks, compatibility metadata, SBOM references, signature requirements, version channels, dependency declarations, and upgrade semantics.

**Why a standard is needed.** Helm Charts solve the templating problem but not the lifecycle problem; Operators solve the lifecycle problem but not the catalog problem. The Marketplace category is fragmented across ApplicationDefinitions, OperatorHub, Helm Hub, and proprietary catalogs. A unified, signed, conformance-testable application manifest is a missing layer.

**Reference implementation.** Cozystack core (`cozystack-operator`, `cozystack-controller`, `cozyhr`).

**Target venue.** CNCF TAG Workloads Foundation as a draft spec; long-term, a CNCF-hosted sub-project (sibling to OCI / SLSA).

**Timeline.**

| Quarter | Milestone |
|---|---|
| 2026 Q4 | First public CzEP draft of CP-API v0.1. |
| 2027 Q1 | Submit to CNCF TAG Workloads Foundation for community review. |
| 2027 Q2 | Conformance test suite for CP-API published. |
| 2027 Q4 | Second independent implementation lands (target: a Marketplace partner). |
| 2028 Q2 | CP-API v1.0 ratified. |

#### 8.1.2 Cloud Tenant API (`CT-API`)

**What.** A specification for what it means to be an isolated tenant on a Kubernetes-based platform. Defines the composition of namespace, NetworkPolicy, RBAC, ResourceQuota, scheduling boundaries, audit context, and identity binding required to constitute a "tenant" with explicit isolation guarantees.

**Why a standard is needed.** Every multi-tenant platform — vCluster, Kamaji, Capsule, HNC, Rancher Projects, OpenShift Projects — defines tenancy slightly differently. There is no portable answer to "is workload X isolated from workload Y in tenant Z." Cross-platform tenancy assurances matter for compliance auditors, for regulated industries, and for service providers who need to express tenant boundaries in contracts.

**Reference implementation.** Cozystack `tenant` core package plus Cilium-based network isolation.

**Target venue.** Kubernetes SIG Auth (multi-tenancy) and CNCF TAG Workloads Foundation co-sponsorship.

**Timeline.**

| Quarter | Milestone |
|---|---|
| 2027 Q1 | First public CzEP draft of CT-API v0.1. |
| 2027 Q2 | Engagement with Kubernetes SIG Auth (multi-tenancy) upstream. |
| 2027 Q3 | Conformance assertions integrated into the Cozystack Conformance Suite. |
| 2028 Q1 | Second independent implementation lands. |

#### 8.1.3 Host OS Contract (`HOC`)

**What.** A specification of what a platform requires from its host operating system: kernel modules, container runtime, kubelet configuration, sysctl set, secure-boot expectations, AppArmor/SELinux/seccomp posture, networking stack (eBPF features, kernel version floor), storage drivers (DRBD, ZFS, LVM), GPU drivers and CDI compliance, observability surface (`/proc`, `/sys` access), and bootstrapping interface.

**Why a standard is needed.** Today every Kubernetes platform implicitly ties to one or two host OS distributions. A formal contract enables **multi-OS support** as a first-class property, not a porting project. It also allows host OS distributions (Talos, Flatcar, Bottlerocket, Ubuntu Server, openSUSE MicroOS) to validate themselves against the contract.

**Reference implementation.** Cozystack host OS profiles (Talos Tier-1; Ubuntu/Debian/Flatcar Tier-2).

**Target venue.** CNCF TAG Infrastructure; engagement with Sidero (Talos), Flatcar (Kinvolk / Microsoft), Amazon (Bottlerocket), and Canonical (Ubuntu) for co-authorship.

**Timeline.**

| Quarter | Milestone |
|---|---|
| 2026 Q3 | `HOST-OS-CONTRACT.md` v0.1 published in-repo (paired with Track 5). |
| 2026 Q4 | Host Conformance Suite v0.1. |
| 2027 Q1 | Co-author engagement with at least two host OS vendor projects. |
| 2027 Q3 | Submit as a draft CNCF specification. |
| 2028 Q1 | First non-Cozystack platform adopts HOC. |

#### 8.1.4 GitOps Engine Interface (`GEI`)

**What.** An abstraction layer above specific GitOps engines (Flux, Argo CD), modeled on how CRI abstracted Kubernetes from container runtimes. Defines the contract a platform expects from its GitOps engine: package reconciliation, drift detection, source authentication, signed-manifest verification, dependency ordering, status reporting, and upgrade semantics.

**Why a standard is needed.** Enterprises standardize on one GitOps engine and rarely switch. A platform locked to one engine forces a binary adoption decision. GEI allows platforms (Cozystack, OpenShift GitOps, Rancher Fleet, kubectl-only deployments) to express the same intent across engines, and lets engines evolve independently.

**Reference implementation.** Cozystack's planned GitOps Engine Abstraction CzEP (Track 1, 2026 Q3).

**Target venue.** OpenGitOps Working Group (CNCF App Delivery), with co-authorship from Flux and Argo maintainers.

**Timeline.**

| Quarter | Milestone |
|---|---|
| 2026 Q3 | CzEP draft of GEI v0.1 (paired with Track 1). |
| 2026 Q4 | Engagement with Flux and Argo maintainer groups. |
| 2027 Q2 | GEI v0.1 supports both Flux and Argo CD as Cozystack engines. |
| 2027 Q4 | Submit to OpenGitOps WG as a community spec. |

#### 8.1.5 Fleet API (Multi-Cluster Federation)

**What.** A federation API that abstracts multi-cluster lifecycle, identity, networking, policy, and observability into a single declarative surface. Tenant boundaries traverse clusters; applications declare cluster placement constraints; policies federate; observability federates.

**Why a standard is needed.** Multi-cluster solutions today (Karmada, Open Cluster Management, Liqo, KubeFed legacy, Rancher Fleet, ArgoCD ApplicationSets) overlap in scope but do not interoperate. A federation landscape with no shared interface forces enterprises to commit to one vendor's multi-cluster vision.

**Reference implementation.** Cozystack `Fleet API` planned for Track 9 (2027 Q1 alpha → 2027 Q4 GA).

**Target venue.** Kubernetes SIG Multicluster co-sponsored with CNCF TAG Workloads Foundation.

**Timeline.**

| Quarter | Milestone |
|---|---|
| 2027 Q1 | Fleet API v0.1 alpha published; CzEP draft. |
| 2027 Q2 | Engagement with Karmada, OCM, and Liqo maintainer groups for harmonization. |
| 2027 Q3 | Submit to Kubernetes SIG Multicluster. |
| 2028 Q1 | Fleet API v1.0 — Cozystack GA implementation plus one other independent implementation. |

#### 8.1.6 Cloud-Native AI Inference Gateway (`CN-AI-Inference`)

**What.** A specification for an AI inference gateway abstracting model serving engines (vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM, Dynamo, Triton) behind a unified API surface. Includes OpenAI-compatible endpoints, token-level metering, multi-model routing, model-registry binding, and FinOps metric emission.

**Why a standard is needed.** Every AI inference service today re-implements the same gateway: rate limiting, token counting, model selection, routing to the appropriate engine. There is no portable contract for what "an inference endpoint" means at platform level.

**Reference implementation.** Cozystack Inference Gateway (Track 6, planned 2027 Q2).

**Target venue.** CNCF CNAI Working Group, MLCommons engagement.

**Timeline.**

| Quarter | Milestone |
|---|---|
| 2026 Q4 | Engagement with CNAI WG; submit Cozystack to CNAI Landscape (Track 6 2026 Q3). |
| 2027 Q2 | CN-AI-Inference v0.1 alpha spec published. |
| 2027 Q3 | Working group draft submitted to CNCF CNAI WG. |
| 2027 Q4 | Reference implementation GA in Cozystack. |
| 2028 Q2 | Second independent implementation lands. |

#### 8.1.7 Block Replication CSI Extension (`BR-CSI`)

**What.** An extension to the CSI specification covering replicated block storage semantics: replication topology, peer discovery, failover, quorum, split-brain resolution, snapshot replication, and disaster recovery coordination. blockstor's LINSTOR-compatible REST API is a starting point; a portable CSI extension is the destination.

**Why a standard is needed.** Replicated block storage today is vendor-specific (LINSTOR/DRBD, Portworx, OpenEBS Mayastor, Ceph RBD with mirroring). Migration between storage vendors requires re-architecting the application's storage assumptions. A CSI extension lets platforms express replication requirements portably.

**Reference implementation.** Cozystack `blockstor` (paired with Track 4).

**Target venue.** Kubernetes SIG Storage, CSI specification sub-project.

**Timeline.**

| Quarter | Milestone |
|---|---|
| 2027 Q2 | First public BR-CSI v0.1 draft. |
| 2027 Q3 | Engagement with Ceph CSI, Portworx, OpenEBS, LINBIT maintainer groups. |
| 2027 Q4 | Submit to SIG Storage as a CSI extension proposal. |
| 2028 Q2 | First non-blockstor implementation lands. |

#### 8.1.8 Tenant FinOps API

**What.** A specification for per-tenant resource accounting and chargeback, including CPU-seconds, memory-byte-seconds, storage-IOPS-seconds, network-bytes, GPU-time, AI token-time, KV-cache hits, image-pull bytes, and other dimensions relevant for multi-tenant platforms. Schema is emit-friendly (OpenTelemetry-compatible) and consumption-friendly (OpenCost-compatible).

**Why a standard is needed.** FinOps in multi-tenant Kubernetes is fragmented: OpenCost handles workload-level cost, Kubecost overlays UI, but per-tenant attribution at the AI-inference and GPU-time level is unspecified. Service providers each invent a metering schema.

**Reference implementation.** Cozystack S3 metering (1.3) plus planned Tenant FinOps view (Track 6 2027 Q2).

**Target venue.** FinOps Foundation Open Source Working Group, OpenCost sub-project.

**Timeline.**

| Quarter | Milestone |
|---|---|
| 2027 Q2 | First public Tenant FinOps API v0.1 draft. |
| 2027 Q3 | Engagement with OpenCost, Kubecost, and FinOps Foundation. |
| 2027 Q4 | Submit as a working draft to FinOps Foundation OSS WG. |
| 2028 Q1 | Reference implementation in Cozystack GA. |

### 8.2 Specifications Cozystack Adopts and Champions

| **DMTF** | Data center management standards (Redfish, etc.). | Conditional on hardware integration depth. |

### 8.4 Distinguishing Artifacts — The "Cozystack Way"

A category is also defined by a few visible artifacts that become synonymous with the category. Linux has `/etc`, `ELF`, `Makefile`, `grep | awk | sed`. Kubernetes has `kubectl apply -f`, `Pod`, `Service`, `Operator`. Docker had `Dockerfile`. Cozystack needs three to five such recognizable artifacts.

Candidate artifacts:

| Artifact | What it stands for | Why it differentiates |
|---|---|---|
| **`ApplicationDefinition`** | The Cozystack equivalent of "what a managed cloud-native app is." | If CP-API succeeds, "ApplicationDefinition" enters industry vocabulary as the signed, conformance-tested app manifest. |
| **`Package` / `PackageSource`** | The Cozystack package model, decoupled from Helm rendering. | Eliminates the `helm template lookup` race-condition class. Recognizable as "the Cozystack package model." |
| **`Tenant`** as a first-class CRD | The Cozystack tenancy model with explicit isolation guarantees. | If CT-API succeeds, "tenant" gains a portable meaning. |
| **`cozystack` CLI** | The primary user surface — single entry point. | Replaces `kubectl + helm + make` patchwork; recognizable Cozystack-ism. |
| **`cozydoctor`** | Built-in AI-assisted diagnostics. | Distinctive UX; pairs Cozystack with AI-assisted operations narrative. |
| **Cozystack Certified badges** | Visible certification marks: Certified Provider / App / Storage / OS. | Forces ecosystem to express "Cozystack-compatible" as a verifiable claim. |
| **Cozystack Federation** | Single control plane across many clusters, via Fleet API. | If Fleet API succeeds, "federation" gains a portable meaning. |

Each artifact should be referenced consistently across:

- The website (`cozystack.io`).
- The documentation site.
- All conference talks.
- All whitepapers, briefs, and case studies.
- The brand kit (Track 12.7) — visual treatment of `cozystack` typography and badge marks.

### 8.5 Adoption Playbook

Specifications without adopters are paper. Without an adoption playbook, the work in §8.1–8.4 produces well-written documents that no one implements. This playbook covers the marketing, partner, and ecosystem work required for the specifications to be picked up.

#### 8.5.1 Conference and event circuit

| Event | Cadence | Target Cozystack presence |
|---|---|---|
| KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America | Annual (Nov) | Minimum 2 accepted talks; sponsor booth from 2027. |
| KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe | Annual (Mar) | Minimum 2 accepted talks. |
| CloudFest (Europe) | Annual (Mar) | Hosting/service-provider audience; minimum 1 talk. |
| CloudFest Americas | Annual (Nov) | Service-provider audience; minimum 1 talk. |
| Open Source Summit Europe / NA | Annual | Standards-track engagement. |
| FOSDEM | Annual (Feb) | Maintainer-track talks. |
| SREcon | Annual | Operations-narrative engagement. |

Target: **a minimum of 12 accepted talks per calendar year** across the above events, across diverse contributor organizations.

#### 8.5.2 Hardware vendor program

A "Tested on Cozystack" certification program for hardware platforms. Modeled on the Linux Foundation's "Tested with Linux" certifications and the Red Hat Certified Hardware program.

| Quarter | Deliverables |
|---|---|
| 2027 Q1 | Hardware Compatibility Lab established (initially a Cozystack-hosted lab; eventually federated). Test profiles for bare-metal servers, network switches, GPUs. |
| 2027 Q2 | Initial vendor engagements: Dell PowerEdge, HPE ProLiant, Supermicro, Lenovo ThinkSystem, GIGABYTE. NVIDIA NCP Reference Platform validation pipeline. |
| 2027 Q3 | Public Hardware Compatibility List (HCL). |
| 2027 Q4 | At least 20 certified hardware configurations across 3+ vendors. |
| 2028 Q1+ | Storage vendor certifications (VAST, WEKA, DDN, Pure) and network vendor certifications (Arista, Cisco Nexus, Broadcom, Mellanox/NVIDIA Networking). |

#### 8.5.3 Host OS distribution program

Co-publish Host OS profiles with major Linux distributions, validating against the Host OS Contract (§8.1.3).

| Quarter | Deliverables |
|---|---|
| 2026 Q4 | Talos profile co-signed with Sidero. Initial engagement with Flatcar (Kinvolk / Microsoft), Ubuntu (Canonical), openSUSE MicroOS, Bottlerocket (Amazon). |
| 2027 Q2 | Ubuntu 26.04 LTS profile co-published with Canonical. |
| 2027 Q3 | Flatcar profile co-published. openSUSE MicroOS profile. |
| 2027 Q4 | Bottlerocket profile (if engagement with Amazon succeeds). |

#### 8.5.4 Hyperscaler and provider engagement

Long-term, "Linux of platforms" requires managed Cozystack instances from multiple service providers — analogous to managed Kubernetes from every cloud.

| Quarter | Deliverables |
|---|---|
| 2027 Q3 | Engagement with European service providers (Hetzner, OVH, Scaleway, IONOS) for managed Cozystack offerings. |
| 2027 Q4 | Hyperscaler engagement: AWS Marketplace listing; GCP Marketplace listing; Azure Marketplace listing. |
| 2028 Q1+ | First managed Cozystack from a hyperscaler (target: a sovereign-cloud focused European provider). |

#### 8.5.5 Certification and labor market

Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) created the K8s skill labor market. Cozystack Admin Certification (CCA) does the same for Cozystack.

| Quarter | Deliverables |
|---|---|
| 2027 Q3 | CCA beta (paired with Track 11 and Track 12.6). |
| 2027 Q4 | CCA GA. Recruiter outreach: include "Cozystack" in keyword sets used by major IT recruiters. |
| 2028 Q1+ | Cozystack Certified Developer (CCD) and Cozystack Certified Architect (CCAr) exam tracks. |

| 2028 Q1+ | Engage with national clouds: Spain ENS, Germany BSI C5, France SecNumCloud, Italy AGID, India MeitY empanelment criteria. |

#### 8.5.8 Vendor-neutrality transparency

Standards adoption is undermined by perceived single-vendor concentration. The vendor-neutrality dashboard (Track 11 2028 Q2) must launch as a **public** artifact, not an internal metric.

| Metric | Source | Cadence |
|---|---|---|
| Commits by organization | GitHub API | Monthly |
| Maintainers by organization | `MAINTAINERS.md` | Per change |
| Releases by organization (release lead) | Release tagging | Per release |
| Working group chairs by organization | SIG charters | Per change |
| Conference talks by organization | Talk tracker | Quarterly |
| External adopters in production | `ADOPTERS.md` | Per change |

### 8.6 Annual Standardization Review

Each Q1, the maintainer group conducts a public **Standardization Review**:

- For each spec in §8.1: status (draft / submitted / under review / adopted / second-implementation), blockers, owner SIG.
- For each Tier 1/2/3 body in §8.3: engagement state, designated representative, last activity, action items.
- For each distinguishing artifact in §8.4: visibility check (does it appear in talks, docs, brand assets?).
- For the adoption playbook in §8.5: progress on hardware program, OS program, hyperscaler engagement, certification numbers, academic and regulatory traction.

Output: a public **Standardization Review YYYY** document published alongside the Annual Report (Track 12.4). The first review lands in **2027 Q1**.

### 8.7 Summary: What Determines Whether Cozystack Becomes a Standard

The single hardest question in this document. The honest answer is that no list of activities guarantees standardhood. What the evidence from Linux, Kubernetes, and the OCI/CRI transition does suggest:

1. **Specifications are owned by neutral bodies, not by the project.** Cozystack must be willing to relinquish the specs in §8.1 to CNCF or another standards body, even at the cost of slower iteration.
2. **Multiple independent implementations are required.** A spec with one implementation is documentation; a spec with two is a standard. The roadmap targets a second implementation for each major spec by 2028.
3. **Conformance distinguishes "compatible" from "claimed-compatible."** The Conformance Program (§6) is the enforcement mechanism.
4. **The labor market is the deepest moat.** A pool of CCA-certified engineers, university courses using Cozystack, and recruiters listing "Cozystack" skills create demand pressure on enterprises.
5. **Vendor neutrality is non-negotiable.** Apparent single-vendor concentration kills standardhood faster than technical flaws. The transparency artifacts in §8.5.8 must be public, frequent, and maintained.

The two-year roadmap is a starting condition, not the destination. By the end of the horizon (May 2028), Cozystack should be **plausible** as a category standard. Actual category-standard status will be earned, if at all, over the following five to ten years, through sustained execution of the principles above.

## 9. Risks and Anti-Goals

Acknowledging what could derail the plan or push the project away from its goal:

- **Storage rewrite scope creep.** blockstor must hit a clear feature parity bar before broadening scope. A 12–18-month rewrite that grows new features faster than it ships is a known failure mode.
- **Host OS distro adventure.** Forking Talos into a full Linux distribution is enormous work and risks turning Cozystack into a distro vendor instead of a platform standard. The conservative path in §5 (Track 5) is deliberate.
- **The core / apps separation stays undecided.** Three competing designs exist and none has been chosen. The marketplace, the `apps.cozystack.io` API split and the retirement of the `extra` category all sit downstream of it, so leaving it open does not defer one item, it defers a quarter of Track 8 and part of Track 1 — and any work started before the decision risks being redone against a different shape. This is why the decision is scheduled ahead of the work that depends on it rather than alongside it.
- **Marketplace without certification pipeline.** Opening external app submissions before SBOM, signing, and conformance gates exist creates supply-chain risk for adopters.
- **AI layer without GPU accounting and data governance** will be perceived as a demo, not a platform.
- **Multi-cluster without stable identity, networking, and policy** becomes a collection of integrations rather than a federation product.
- **SOC 2 / PCI scope drift.** These standards apply to *deployments*, not to an OSS project. We deliver evidence packs and reference architectures, not a stamp on the project itself.
- **blockstor is governed inside Cozystack** rather than as a separate project. The risk this carries is that adopters read it as a Cozystack-internal component rather than a storage choice available to the wider ecosystem; the mitigation is LINSTOR API compatibility, a public conformance suite, and contributors from outside the founding company — not a second governance structure.
- **Vendor-neutrality concentration.** The single largest CNCF Graduation risk is contributor concentration in one organization. Track 11 directly addresses this; the maintainer-diversity work must succeed.

## 10. How This Roadmap Is Maintained

- Each track has an owning SIG (see §7).
- Each quarter, the maintainers conduct a public roadmap review and update this document. The current Project V2 board remains the granular issue-level source of truth for in-quarter work; this document gives the multi-quarter view.
- The initial roadmap (this document) was ratified via maintainer review when it was first merged; thereafter, material changes to the roadmap are proposed via a CzEP (Cozystack Enhancement Proposal) in [cozystack/community/design-proposals](https://github.com/cozystack/community/tree/main/design-proposals).
- The document is versioned in `git` history; major revisions are tagged.
