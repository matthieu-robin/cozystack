# Managed MongoDB Service

MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database known for its flexibility and scalability.
The Managed MongoDB Service provides a self-healing replicated cluster managed by the Percona Operator for MongoDB.

## Deployment Details

This managed service is controlled by the Percona Operator for MongoDB, ensuring efficient management and seamless operation.

## Deployment Modes

### Replica Set Mode (default)

By default, MongoDB deploys as a replica set with the specified number of replicas.
This mode is suitable for most use cases requiring high availability.

### Sharded Cluster Mode

Enable `sharding: true` for horizontal scaling across multiple shards.
Each shard is a replica set, and mongos routers handle query routing.

## Notes

### TLS Mode

TLS is fully managed by the PSMDB operator via its native cert-manager integration. When TLS is enabled (explicitly or auto-enabled by `external: true`), the operator creates the complete certificate chain:

- A self-signed CA Issuer and CA Certificate
- A CA-backed Issuer
- A leaf TLS certificate with SANs covering the replica set service, per-pod DNS names, wildcards, and localhost

The chart does **not** render cert-manager `Issuer` or `Certificate` resources. The operator manages these directly, and chart-rendered cert-manager objects would be orphaned and ignored as trust anchors.

TLS mode is set to `preferTLS`, which means the MongoDB server accepts both TLS and non-TLS connections.

> **Note:** `preferTLS` is intentional because the operator's backup CronJob does not yet support TLS. Strict enforcement (`requireTLS`) will be added in a follow-up once the backup workflow supports it. To enforce TLS at the network layer in the meantime, restrict client access via NetworkPolicy.

> **External hostname SANs:** When `external: true` is enabled, the chart advertises per-pod LoadBalancer hostnames to the operator via `splitHorizons`, and the operator (PSMDB ≥ 1.22.0 with `crVersion: 1.22.0`, both shipped by this chart) folds those hostnames into the leaf certificate SAN list. External clients can then verify the TLS hostname, provided `<release>-rs0-<i>.<host>` resolves to the corresponding per-pod LoadBalancer — DNS is an operational prerequisite you must satisfy.
>
> The external hostnames are derived from `_namespace.host`, which the Cozystack controller injects per tenant. In the brief window before the controller populates it (or when the chart is rendered outside Cozystack), TLS is still enabled but `splitHorizons` is omitted, so the certificate does not yet cover external hostnames; this resolves automatically on the next reconcile once `_namespace.host` is present.

### Sharding and TLS

> **Warning:** When `sharding: true`, TLS coverage for `mongos` routers depends on the operator's SAN generation. The operator-managed certificate covers replica set member SANs; `mongos` endpoint coverage may be incomplete. TLS connections to `mongos` routers should be tested after enabling sharding with TLS.

### External Access

When `external: true` is enabled:
- **Replica Set mode**: Traffic is load-balanced across all replica set members. This works well for read operations, but write operations require connecting to the primary. MongoDB drivers handle primary discovery automatically using the replica set connection string.
- **Sharded mode**: Traffic is routed through mongos routers, which handle both reads and writes correctly.

### Credentials

On first install, the credentials secret will be empty until the Percona operator initializes the cluster.
Run `helm upgrade` after MongoDB is ready to populate the credentials secret with the actual password.

### Data lifecycle

When the MongoDB release is uninstalled, the operator finalizers reclaim release-scoped resources:

**Reclaimed by the `percona.com/delete-psmdb-pvc` finalizer:**

- All PVCs backing the replica set storage. Whether the underlying PersistentVolume and on-disk data are actually deleted depends on the StorageClass `reclaimPolicy` (`Delete` removes them, `Retain` leaves them for manual cleanup).
- Operator-managed secrets:
  - `<release>-percona-server-mongodb-users` — operator users credentials
  - `internal-<release>` — internal operator state
  - `internal-<release>-users` — operator-internal users data
  - `<release>-mongodb-encryption-key` — at-rest encryption key

**Reclaimed by `helm uninstall`:**

- `<release>-credentials` — connection string for application code
- `<release>-user-<username>` — per-user passwords
- `<release>-s3-creds` — backup destination credentials (if backups are configured)

**Not reclaimed automatically:**

- TLS secrets `<release>-ssl`, `<release>-ssl-internal`, and `<release>-ca-cert` — created by the PSMDB operator via cert-manager — remain in the namespace after uninstall. Delete them manually if no longer needed. The operator also creates intermediate cert-manager `Issuer` and `Certificate` objects (named `<release>-*`); these must also be cleaned up manually if the operator is removed before the PSMDB CR is deleted.

**Recovery from a stuck deletion:**

If the `psmdb-operator` is uninstalled before MongoDB CRs are deleted, the finalizers cannot run and the `PerconaServerMongoDB` CR hangs in `Terminating`. To recover, clear the finalizers manually:

```bash
kubectl --namespace <namespace> patch psmdb <release> --type merge --patch '{"metadata":{"finalizers":[]}}'
```

Note that this skips the operator-driven cleanup — PVCs and operator-managed secrets will remain orphaned and must be removed manually.

If you need to retain data, take a backup before deletion. Refer to the [Percona Operator for MongoDB documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-mongodb/) for backup/restore workflows.

### Upgrading from earlier versions

Earlier versions of this chart referenced a namespace-shared system users secret (`percona-server-mongodb-users`). Upgrading to a release that scopes this secret per CR (`<release>-percona-server-mongodb-users`) triggers a password rotation for the operator-managed system users. The rotation is performed in place by the Percona operator via `db.changeUserPassword()` against the running mongod (operator log: `Secret data changed. Updating users...`); pods are not restarted and the cluster stays available.

**Rotated automatically on upgrade:**

- The five operator-managed system accounts: `databaseAdmin`, `userAdmin`, `backup`, `clusterAdmin`, `clusterMonitor`.
- Secret `<release>-percona-server-mongodb-users` (newly created, per-CR) and `internal-<release>-users` receive the new values.
- Secret `<release>-credentials` is regenerated; its `password` and `uri` keys reflect the new `databaseAdmin` password.

**Not affected:**

- Custom users defined under `users:` in chart values. Their `<release>-user-<name>` secrets are not touched.
- The at-rest encryption key (`<release>-mongodb-encryption-key`) and replica set keyfile (`<release>-mongodb-keyfile`) are unchanged, so on-disk data remains readable.

**Action required after upgrade:**

Workloads that mount `<release>-credentials` keep using the cached old password until they re-read the secret. Restart those pods, or run a controller such as [Reloader](https://github.com/stakater/Reloader) to roll them automatically. Without this, application connections fail with authentication errors once their existing sessions expire.

**Orphaned legacy secret:**

The previous namespace-shared secret `percona-server-mongodb-users` is no longer referenced by any MongoDB CR after upgrade, but the operator does not garbage-collect it. If multiple MongoDB releases in the same namespace previously shared it, all of them rotate to their own per-CR secrets — passwords are no longer shared across CRs in the namespace, which is the intended outcome. Confirm no other consumers reference it, then remove it manually:

```bash
kubectl --namespace <namespace> delete secret percona-server-mongodb-users
```

> `storageClass` is annotated as immutable in the chart schema — see [`docs/storage-immutability.md`](../../../docs/storage-immutability.md) for the contract and which consumers enforce it.
