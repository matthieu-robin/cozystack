Active-path seed for spec.instances = max(.Values.replicas, effectiveMin). This is
the CONSTANT the chart writes to spec.instances whenever autoscaling is active. Two
properties matter and both hold:
  - it never undercuts the quorum/read floor (it is >= effectiveMin), so CNPG admits
    the Cluster and a fresh enable lands at a valid count;
  - it equals .Values.replicas whenever replicas has been staged at/above the floor,
    so the else-branch (dryRun/transition/off, which renders instances: replicas) and
    this active branch render the SAME value — the client-side patch (previous-vs-new
    render) is then empty across an enable / dryRun / transition-phase-2 flip and the
    live count does not dip.
Seeding effectiveMin alone (an earlier variant) made the two branches differ, so a
transition phase-2 flip rebased a staged live count down to the bare floor, shedding
replicas + PVCs the "warm hand-off" was supposed to preserve. Because the seed is a
constant, each reconcile renders the same value it rendered last time, so under
client-side apply the patch is empty and KEDA's higher live value written through /scale
is never reverted — helm-controller patches this CRD from the previous-vs-new rendered
manifest and does not consult live state (it leaves Helm's threeWayMergeForUnstructured at
the default). CAVEAT: this no-op holds only while the seed VALUE is unchanged between
renders; editing replicas / minReplicas / quorum.maxSyncReplicas moves the seed, and the
two-way patch then resets spec.instances to the new seed in one step (see the values.yaml
@field notes on those keys). BUT the whole scheme holds only under CLIENT-SIDE apply. The
platform's helm-controller (v1.5.0) defaults to server-side apply, which force-owns any
rendered field and reverts it from KEDA's /scale value; so the postgres ApplicationDefinition
forces client-side apply via release.cozystack.io/helm-server-side-apply: "false" (see the
db.yaml seed comment + pkg/registry/apps/application/rest.go). An omit-under-active design
was evaluated and rejected: under SSA the phase-2 handoff prunes spec.instances whenever
KEDA has not yet written /scale (e.g. a cluster idle at its floor), collapsing it to 1 —

{{/*
Read-load metric: Σ(read load over the standby pods) + target, fed to KEDA as an
AverageValue trigger so stock HPA computes
desired = ceil((Σ + target) / target) = 1 + ceil(Σ / target) = primaryCount + desiredRead.
The join restricts the metric to this app's standby pods; the namespace matcher
scopes it to the tenant. The read load is floored to zero ONLY when replica pods
exist, so an idle cluster still returns `target` (→ desired 1, clamped up by
minReplicaCount) while a cluster whose carrying series are absent returns empty
(fail-safe hold — see the caveat below), instead of an unconditional `or vector(0)`
that cannot tell no-load from no-series.

Replication-lag brake (postgres.autoscaling.query, when maxReplicationLagSeconds>0):
while the max standby lag has exceeded the threshold at any point in the cooldown
window AND the primary is actively writing WAL, the query returns
`currentInstances * target` instead of `Σ + target`, which pins desired to the
current instance count and freezes scaling in BOTH directions (safer than pinning
maxReplicas, which would still allow scale-down under lag). Using max_over_time for
the lag term is the hysteresis band — the brake holds for the cooldown after a spike
rather than flapping on a single sample. The write gate (rate over WAL records > 0)
keeps an idle primary from tripping the brake. Metrics verified live on CNPG 1.30.0:
cnpg_pg_replication_lag (seconds) and cnpg_collector_wal_records exist and carry
namespace/pod; the design's cnpg_pg_stat_replication_sent_diff_bytes does not, so
WAL-record rate is the write signal. The cluster is scoped by joining kube_pod_labels
on (namespace,pod), same as the read-load term. The exact thresholds/cooldown are
tuned per the proposal's PoC; the base (no-lag) path is validated live.

Fail-safe (per the design proposal, "must not read a missing sample as zero" / "No
blind scaling"), SCOPED to the kube-state-metrics pod-label join: the read-load floor is
GATED on the existence of ANY CNPG instance pod (count(kube_pod_labels{...instance_role
=~".+"}) > 0), so the query separates two empty cases an unconditional `or vector(0)`
would conflate:
  - the cluster has instance pods (running idle, or still provisioning its replicas) but
    no active read connections -> load 0 -> desired 1 (scale to floor);
  - NO CNPG pod labels exist at all (a broken KSM pod-label pipeline) -> the floor is
    WITHHELD, the term stays empty. The cozy-lib helper pins ignoreNullValues=false on the
    trigger, so KEDA treats an empty result as an error (FailedGetExternalMetric) rather
    than its default of 0, and the HPA HOLDS the current count. (Without
    ignoreNullValues=false the empty result would read as 0 -> desired 0 -> clamp to the
    floor, i.e. a silent scale-DOWN — the exact failure this gate exists to prevent.)
The gate keys on ANY instance role (not replica-only) precisely so initial provisioning /
large restore — when the only replica-side pod is CNPG's join Job (jobRole, not
instanceRole) — floors on the primary and does NOT error; a replica-only gate would
spuriously trip DatabaseAutoscalerScalerErrors on a healthy basebackup that routinely
exceeds the alert's 15m window.
LIMIT: the gate keys on kube_pod_labels, not on the load-metric source. If kube_pod_labels
is healthy but the load series itself vanishes (cnpg_backends_total unscraped/renamed, or
container_cpu_usage_seconds_total absent for the CPU metric — a separate cAdvisor
pipeline), the term still floors to 0 and the cluster drifts down toward the floor
silently (the query returns a valid 0, so ScalerErrors does not fire). That drift is
bounded (never below the quorum floor, no collapse) and heavily damped (scaleDown
stabilization 1800s, 1 pod / 600s); operators should still alert on absent load series
for autoscaled namespaces. NOTE the opt-in lag brake below (maxReplicationLagSeconds > 0):
gating the floor on any instance role also keeps its base term non-empty during
provisioning so it no longer errors there; it stays opt-in / not-live-validated.
