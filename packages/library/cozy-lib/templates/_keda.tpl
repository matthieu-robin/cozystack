{{/*
cozy-lib.keda.scaledObject renders a KEDA ScaledObject that drives an engine
operator's /scale subresource from a single VictoriaMetrics query.

This is the whole runtime of database read-replica autoscaling in cozystack:
the app chart renders this object, and stock KEDA queries VictoriaMetrics,
computes the desired count with an HPA it manages, and writes the engine CR's
scale subresource. There is no bespoke controller (see the design proposal
"database-horizontal-autoscaling"). The helper is engine-agnostic: the caller
supplies the already-computed effective bounds (the synchronous-quorum floor is
engine-specific and belongs in the chart, not here), the scale target, and the
metric query.

Invoked with a single dict argument:

  {{ include "cozy-lib.keda.scaledObject" (dict
       "name"            .Release.Name
       "namespace"       .Release.Namespace
       "scaleTargetRef"  (dict "apiVersion" "postgresql.cnpg.io/v1" "kind" "Cluster" "name" .Release.Name)
       "minReplicaCount" $effectiveMin
       "maxReplicaCount" $effectiveMax
       "serverAddress"   $vmselectURL
       "query"           $promql
       "threshold"       "150"
       "behavior"        $hpaBehavior      # optional; HPA behavior block, carried verbatim
       "paused"          $paused           # true to render paused; a caller pauses for BOTH dry-run AND migration transition, not dry-run alone
       "labels"          (dict "app.kubernetes.io/instance" .Release.Name)
  ) }}

Parameters:
  - name            (required) ScaledObject name. Convention: the release name.
  - scaleTargetRef  (required) dict with apiVersion, kind, name of the CR to scale.
  - minReplicaCount (required) effective lower bound (chart computes the quorum floor).
  - maxReplicaCount (required) effective upper bound; must be >= minReplicaCount.
  - serverAddress   (required) Prometheus-API URL of the tenant's vmselect.
  - query           (required) PromQL whose value / threshold is the desired count.
  - threshold       (required) AverageValue target; desired = ceil(query / threshold).
  - namespace       (optional) metadata.namespace.
  - behavior        (optional) HPA behavior block (scale-down pacing etc.), carried verbatim.
  - paused          (optional) when true, stamps autoscaling.keda.sh/paused-scale-in
                    AND paused-scale-out =true (dry-run / recommendation mode — KEDA
                    keeps the HPA and keeps serving its metric but actuates in neither
                    direction). Deliberately not the full paused=true, which in KEDA
                    2.20.2 deletes the HPA and blinds the dashboard/alerts. Because both
                    scaling policies are disabled, the HPA's desiredReplicas is frozen to
                    the current count; read the recommendation from the served metric
                    (desired = ceil(metric / threshold)), not from desiredReplicas.
  - labels          (optional) extra labels, merged onto the mandatory ones.
  - annotations     (optional) extra annotations, merged under the pause annotations.

       the HPA — which erases the keda-hpa-* series the dashboard and alerts ride on and
       leaves nothing to observe. Pausing BOTH directions instead keeps KEDA's scale loop
       running and the HPA in place (verified against v2.20.2 controllers/keda/hpa.go: the
       pair sets the HPA's ScaleUp AND ScaleDown SelectPolicy to Disabled), so the HPA is
       retained and KEDA keeps serving/scraping the trigger metric. NOTE: with both
       directions disabled the k8s HPA normalizes status.desiredReplicas to
       currentReplicas, so desired does NOT diverge here — the recommendation is read from
       the served metric (keda_scaler_metrics_value, or the read-load panel: desired =
       ceil(metric / threshold)), not from the HPA's desiredReplicas. For the migration
       transition this still makes KEDA genuinely warm: un-pausing hands off without
       recreating the HPA (the HPA's scaleUp stabilization window still applies to the
       first move). */ -}}
