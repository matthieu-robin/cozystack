# Unit tests for the ADOPTION path of platform migration 54.
#
# migration-54-adopt-values.bats pins the jq value-mapping; this file pins the
# adopt_one branch that mutates ownership of running worker objects (annotate
# helm.sh/resource-policy=keep + meta.helm.sh/release-name). The fake kubectl
# serves worker objects via FAKE_OBJS ("<res> <name> <release-name>" lines) and
# KubevirtMachineTemplate names via FAKE_KMT_NAMES, so the annotate, idempotency
# and refusal branches and the 6-hex KMT anchor are exercised directly rather
# than short-circuited on "absent". FAKE_GET_FAIL injects transient
# (non-NotFound) server errors to pin the read contract: NotFound is skipped as
# absent, anything else aborts the run before the version stamp.
#
# cozytest.sh awk parser: @test blocks only, a bare `}` at column 0 ends a test,
# no run/$status/setup/teardown. Assertions are direct shell tests.
# Run with: hack/cozytest.sh hack/migration-54-adopt-path.bats
